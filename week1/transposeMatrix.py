Thought process:
In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal, 
**that is it switches the row and column indices of the matrix** by producing another matrix denoted 
as 
AT (also written Aâ€², Atr, tA or At).

we have an M X N matrix
so what we can do is create a new empty matrix with the following dimensions N X M

We iterate through our M X N matrix and new_matrix [col][row] = old_matrix[row][col]

and we return the new matrix :]
